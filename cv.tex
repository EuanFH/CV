\subsection{Java}
\begin{flushleft}
I have been using Java since I started programming. The majority of my university projects where written in Java. This has made me proficient in Object Orientated development and common design patterns. The most recent project I worked on was an android application using the MVVM design pattern.

\section{Experience}
\runsubsection{1st Line ICT Support}
\descript{| Glasgow Clyde College}
\duration{December 2016 – August 2017}
In this position I learn the importance of working in a team on large projects. Dealing with users directly and quickly getting to the root of their problem via email, phone, and in person which was the most preferable. Working swiftly to resolve there issues in a friendly and professional manner. I also supported the network team when they weren't on campus, confirming issues for them, and restarting servers.
I was also chosen on multiple occasion to work at other campuses, when staff members where absent. Having to quickly integrate into the campuses teams. Supporting them on ongoing tickets.

\section{Personal Interests}
In my spare time I like to work on my home server lab. Having setup my own router using DHCPD for the DHCP server, BIND 9 for the DNS, and Shorewall for the firewall. As well as a storage/application server using containerization with LXD/LXC and ZFS for my storage pools. Container deployment is automated via Ansible.

Using these technologies has given me a good understanding of networking, Linux, and containerization technologies.
