\section{Software Skills}
\subsection{Golang}
\begin{flushleft}
All hobby projects I have written is the past year have been in Golang. I have learned a lot about concurrent systems working with it. Making lightweight REST API servers and clients. Golang is my preferred language for backend web development because of this.

\subsection{Java}
\begin{flushleft}
I have been using Java since I started programming. The majority of my university projects where written in Java. This has made me proficient in Object Orientated development and common design patterns. The most recent project I worked on was an android application using the MVVM design pattern.

\subsection{Javascript \textbullet{} HTML \textbullet{} CSS}
\begin{flushleft}
I have made multiple small web apps through the years. One of which was for a university project which required a single page web application to be made without a framework, this project gave me a much better understanding of javascript and the event loops.

\begin{itemize} 
    \item DHCPD
    \item BIND 9
    \item Shorewall
    \item LXD/LXC
    \item ZFS
    \item Ansible
    \item Linux
    \item Systemd
    \item Nginx
\end{itemize}
\end{multicols}
In my spare time I like to work on my home server lab. Having setup my own router using DHCPD for the DHCP server, BIND 9 for the DNS, and Shorewall for the firewall. As well as a storage/application server using containerization with LXD/LXC. I use ZFS for my storage pools, a 20TB pool for general storage and a 2TB pool for containers. Container deployment is automated via Ansible.

Using these technologies has given me a good understanding of networking, Linux, and containerization technologies.

\subsection{Honors Project}
I created a voice recognition system for discord a VOIP service for my honors project. The project was akin to google home or amazon alexa in desired capability. The application would listen to everyone in the VOIP call and listen for a keyphrase using Pocket Sphinx. Once a keyphrase had been said e.g. ``hey assistant'' the user that said the keyphrase would be able to speak a command. The command utterance is streamed to Googles Cloud Speech To Text API, the resulting text is then processed by rasa a natural language proccessing engine.
