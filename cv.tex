\section{Software Skills}
\subsection{Golang}
\begin{flushleft}
All hobby projects I have written in the past year in my spare time, have been in Golang. It has become my favourite language to use because it give you to ability to write powerful programs whilst being easy to use. Using Golang I have learnt a lot about concurrency since it is a premier feature of the language.

\subsection{Java}
\begin{flushleft}
I have been using Java since I started programming. The majority of my university projects where written in Java. This has made me proficient in Object Orientated development and common design patterns. The most recent project I worked on was an android application using the MVVM design pattern.

\subsection{Javascript \textbullet{} HTML \textbullet{} CSS}
\begin{flushleft}
I have made multiple small web apps through the years. One of which was for a university project which required a single page web application to be made without a framework, this project gave me a much better understanding of Javascript and the event loops.

\section{Experience}
\runsubsection{1st Line ICT Support}
\descript{| Glasgow Clyde College}
\duration{December 2016 – August 2017}
My role in this position was to work on tickets submitted by users and solve their computing related issues.
\begin{itemize}
    \item I learnt the importance of working in a team on large projects.
    \item I gained the knowledge to work with active directory as well as other propietry college system
    \item I developed the ability to swiftly resolve users issues in a professional and friendly manner via phone, email, and face to face.
    \item I supported the networking team by confirming issues and restarting servers.
    \item I was chosen on multiple occasions to work at other campuses, when team members where absent. Quickly integrating into their team and supporting the team on ongoing tickets.
\end{itemize}
During my time in this role one of the many tasks was entering new hardware into the asset register. This process was incredibly long and at a minimum would take 1 hour per lab as it was manually entered per machine. I recognised this was a task that could be easily automated with Python using the Selenium library. Creating the script made the process much more efficient and eliminated the need for manual entry. This reduced the time taken to complete the task to just 10 minutes.

In my spare time I like to work on my home server lab. Having setup my own router using DHCPD for the DHCP server, BIND 9 for the DNS, and Shorewall for the firewall. As well as a storage/application server using containerization with LXD/LXC. I use ZFS for my storage pools, a 20TB pool for general storage and a 2TB pool for containers. Container deployment is automated via Ansible.

Using these technologies has given me a good understanding of networking, Linux, and containerization technologies.

\subsection{Honors Project}
I created a voice recognition system for discord a VOIP service for my honors project. The project was akin to google home or amazon alexa in desired capability. The application would listen to everyone in the VOIP call and listen for a key phrase using Pocket Sphinx. Once a key phrase had been said e.g. ``Hey assistant'' the user that said the key phrase would be able to speak a command. The command utterance is streamed to Googles Cloud Speech To Text API, the resulting text is then processed by Rasa a natural language proccessing engine.
