\section{Software Skills}
\subsection{Golang}
\begin{flushleft}
All hobby projects I have written is the past year have been in Golang. I have learned a lot about concurrent systems working with it. Making lightweight REST API servers and clients. Golang is my preferred language for backend web development because of this.

\subsection{Java}
\begin{flushleft}
I have been using Java since I started programming. The majority of my university projects where written in Java. This has made me proficient in Object Orientated development and common design patterns. The most recent project I worked on was an android application using the MVVM design pattern.

\subsection{Javascript \textbullet{} HTML \textbullet{} CSS}
\begin{flushleft}
I have made multiple small web apps through the years. One of which was for a university project which required a single page web application to be made without a framework, this project gave me a much better understanding of javascript and the event loops.

In my spare time I like to work on my home server lab. Having setup my own router using DHCPD for the DHCP server, BIND 9 for the DNS, and Shorewall for the firewall. As well as a storage/application server using containerization with LXD/LXC. I use ZFS for my storage pools, a 20TB pool for general storage and a 2TB pool for containers. Container deployment is automated via Ansible.

Using these technologies has given me a good understanding of networking, Linux, and containerization technologies.
